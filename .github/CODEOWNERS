# This CODEOWNERS file defines individuals or teams that are responsible
# for code in this repository.

#####
# Code owners are automatically requested for review when someone
# opens a pull request that modifies code that they own. This repository
# has enabled the `required reviews` setting, and therefore all PR's require
# approval from a code owner before the author can merge a pull request.
# Further documentation: https://help.github.com/articles/about-codeowners/

#####
# These owners are the default owners for everything in the repo.
# Unless a later match takes precedence, the users below will be
# requested for review when someone opens a pull request.

#####
# These users own any files in the following directory at the root of
# the repository and any of its subdirectories.
